This addon switches your reputation bar to a faction whenever you gain
rep with that faction. Enter MC and kill a mob, you'll be shown
Hydraxian Waterlords. Enter ZG and kill a mob, you'll be shown
the Zandalar tribe.

Also adds a /rep command that will list all factions you changed rep with during
the current session. Do /rep after a MC run and you'll get a message similar
to 

> Watching Hydraxian Waterlords

> Gained 980 rep with Hydraxian Waterlords this session
